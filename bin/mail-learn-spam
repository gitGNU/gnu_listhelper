# Mailman moderator messages are structured with three mime encoded parts.
# Part 1: A top mailman introduction message.
# Part 2: The original message to the mailing list.
# Part 3: A bottom mailman control message.
#
# Replying to the 3rd part will discard the message.
#
# The process implemented here is to unpack the mime components of the
# message first into the three components.  Some components
# recursively have sub-components that are also unpacked.  These are
# put into the less than descriptive numbered msgNUM.NUM files.
#
# SpamAssassin is run on the original message payload.  If SA
# classifies the message as spam then a control message back to
# mailman is generated to discard the spam.

# This script assumes that the current working directory is $HOME.
# Files are referenced by a relative path.  Below $HOME we ensure that
# no filenames have spaces in them and therefore we do not need to
# guard against whitespace in filenames.

# Configure how sa-learn will be run.
